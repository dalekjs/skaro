# Skaro - DalekJS

This repository is a work-in-progress playground for figuring out how to proceed with the new DalekJS API. 

Docs that lead up to this can be found [here](https://github.com/rodneyrehm/dalek-api/). The new API is trying to bring in ideas expressed in [breaking backward-compatibility](https://github.com/rodneyrehm/dalek-api/blob/master/breaking-bc-api.md)


## Open Topics

* `beforeSuite`/`afterSuite` similar to `beforeUnit`/`afterUnit`
* `beforeDalek`/`afterDalek` similar to `beforeUnit`/`afterUnit`
* inline-function example to circumvent the plugin-infrastructure for one-off code?

required interfaces and packages [research, implementation]

* integration of [CLI](https://github.com/dalekjs/dalek-cli) 
  * handling of CLI arguments, ENV, [config file](https://github.com/dalekjs/dalek/blob/master/lib/dalek/config.js)
* importing dalek test suites and local plugins
  * importing `dalek-*` plugins right off `node_modules`, maybe [matchdep](https://www.npmjs.org/package/matchdep)?
* integration of Reporters ([junit](https://github.com/dalekjs/dalek-reporter-junit), [html](https://github.com/dalekjs/dalek-reporter-html), [json](https://github.com/dalekjs/dalek-reporter-json), [console ?](https://github.com/dalekjs/dalek-reporter-console))
* ~~implement driver facade~~ we'll expose [WD.js](https://github.com/admc/wd) to plugins directly. We're not sure about how to handle "additional features" (like HTTP Auth or SSL certificate validation pages) at this point.

---

convenience [implementation]

* exporting the dalek.* objects (e.g. `dalek.is`, `dalek.assert`, â€¦) to [global](http://nodejs.org/api/globals.html#globals_global) scope. *The test-file loader could export to global scope before loading files and revert that after the files were loaded.*

---

working with browser scripts [research]

* handling of [data()](https://github.com/dalekjs/dalek/blob/master/lib/dalek/actions.js#L1214) what about the old `.buffer()` concept?
* handling of browser-executed scripts
* old-dalek support assertions in the browser
* instrumenting tests based on data provided by the document

---

improve scalability [research]

* look at [dalek.ui](https://github.com/rodneyrehm/dalek-api/blob/master/breaking-bc-api.md#remembering-ui-elements) to compensate for the dropped .query()
* think about **macros** (re-usable unit-fragments)
* look at [semantic phases](https://github.com/rodneyrehm/dalek-api/blob/master/breaking-bc-api.md#semantic-phases)


---

make it production ready [implementation]

* writing tests for the runner
  * create WD.js mock
* convert markdown and meta-object of plugins to HTML documents forming the API documentation (see [action.click](https://github.com/dalekjs/skaro/blob/master/src/plugins/action/action.click.js), [assert.attribute](https://github.com/dalekjs/skaro/blob/master/src/plugins/assert/assert.attribute.js), [is.equal](https://github.com/dalekjs/skaro/blob/master/src/plugins/is/is.equal.js), [until.timeout](https://github.com/dalekjs/skaro/blob/master/src/plugins/until/until.timeout.js))
* implement all the plugins
* implement all the expectations ([chai?](http://chaijs.com/api/assert/))

## dalek-browser-chrome
> [Chromedriver](https://www.npmjs.org/package/chromedriver) (Get rid of the homegrown installer script)

## dalek-browser-firefox
> [Firefox executor](https://github.com/mozilla-b2g/marionette-firefox-host) (Get rid of starting firefox 'manually')
> [Firefox Profile Builder](https://www.npmjs.org/package/marionette-profile-builder) (Better profile management)
> [Firefox Marionette Client](https://www.npmjs.org/package/marionette-client) (Get rid of the own Marionette Protocol impl.)

## dalek-browser-ie
> [selenium-binaries](https://www.npmjs.org/package/selenium-binaries) (Get rid of homegrown installer script, including registry fixes for security settings)
